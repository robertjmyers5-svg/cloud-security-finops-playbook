# AWS Auto-Remediation Bot (S3 Public Access)

This project automatically detects when an S3 bucket becomes public and instantly remediates it by applying secure Block Public Access settings.

It represents real-world cloud security engineering using:
- AWS EventBridge
- AWS Lambda
- AWS IAM (least privilege)
- CloudTrail events
- Security automation patterns

This is exactly the type of automation used by real cloud security teams to enforce guardrails and prevent misconfiguration.
