# Cloud Security + FinOps Playbook
My personal operating manual for cloud security, Zero Trust, IAM, governance, and cost optimization.

I’m a Navy veteran, MBA, and cloud/security learner building a career at the intersection of:

- Cloud Security
- Zero Trust & Identity
- FinOps & Cloud Cost Governance
- Analytics (Power BI)
- Cloud Operations & Governance

This repo is my working playbook — everything I’m learning, documenting, and applying as I transition into Cloud Security + FinOps.

It includes:

- Practical checklists
- Architecture notes
- IAM examples
- FinOps principles & KPIs
- Cost optimization frameworks
- Governance templates
- Hands-on lab guides
- Power BI cloud cost analysis

This is the blueprint of how I think, how I learn, and how I operate.

## Why This Exists

I’m building a long-term cloud career using a simple mindset:

Small steps. Long vision.

This repo serves three goals:

1. Replace my supply chain past with a Cloud + Security identity.
2. Create real, visible artifacts for recruiters and hiring managers.
3. Build a portfolio I can grow throughout my cloud career.
