# Cloud Career Story

I am a U.S. Navy veteran, MBA, and operations leader transitioning into Cloud Security, FinOps, and IT Governance.

## Background
For 20 years in the Navy, I worked in high-pressure, high-stakes environments where discipline, accountability, risk management, and structured execution were mandatory.  
After the military, I led supply chain, logistics, and multi-million-dollar budgets in the private sector.

Across all roles, I focused on:
- reducing risk
- improving processes
- controlling costs
- maintaining operational readiness
- ensuring compliance
- leading teams through complexity

## Why Cloud + Security + FinOps
Cloud is the modern version of everything I’m already good at:

- **Security** → defense-in-depth, access control, protecting assets  
- **FinOps** → cost visibility, forecasting, optimization, accountability  
- **Governance** → policies, oversight, risk management, standards  
- **Operations** → reliability, workflows, troubleshooting, documentation  

## My Goal
Build a career as a Cloud Security / FinOps / Governance professional using the skills I’ve always had — just in a modern, technical environment.

This repo documents that transformation.

Small steps. Long vision.
