Microservices Architecture

Key Principles:
- Independent deployability
- Decoupled services
- Domain-based design
- API-first development

AWS Components:
- ECS or EKS
- API Gateway
- DynamoDB or RDS
- Cloud Map for service discovery

Azure Components:
- AKS
- API Management
- Cosmos DB
- Service Bus for communication

Security Considerations:
- Identity per service
- Network segmentation
- WAF at the ingress
- Encryption in transit (TLS)
