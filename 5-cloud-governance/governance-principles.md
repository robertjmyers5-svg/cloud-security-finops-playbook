# Cloud Governance Principles (10/10 Framework)

These principles guide all governance decisions.

---

# 1. Security-First Architecture
Zero Trust identity + secure defaults.

# 2. Automation Over Manual Review
Enforce governance with Policy-as-Code & CI/CD.

# 3. Least Privilege Everywhere
No standing admin, JIT access only.

# 4. Standardization Over Customization
Standard modules, patterns, naming, tagging.

# 5. Continuous Compliance
Shift-left validation + drift detection.

# 6. Cost Transparency & Accountability
Budgets, alerts, dashboards.

# 7. Policy-as-Code Guardrails
Preventive → Detective → Corrective.

# 8. Approved Resource Baselines
Approved images, SKUs, regions.

# 9. Landing Zone Foundations
Multi-account/subscription structure.

# 10. Measurable Governance KPIs
Compliance %, cost coverage, drift metrics.
