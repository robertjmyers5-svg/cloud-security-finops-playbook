# GitOps Governance

GitOps is the model where Git is the single source of truth for:
- Infrastructure
- Configuration
- Policies
- Deployments

Everything must be:
- Version-controlled
- Peer-reviewed
- Auditable
- Approved via pull requests

Benefits:
- Compliance by design
- Zero drift environments
- Full audit logs
- Faster rollbacks
